# DDTools DMTA

Interactive DMTA (Design-Make-Test-Analyze) cycle visualization for small molecule drug discovery, featuring curated open-source computational tools hosted on GitHub.

## About

DDTools DMTA is a focused companion to [DDTools](https://jubilantsundar.github.io/ddtools/), providing an interactive sunburst chart specifically organized around the DMTA cycle workflow used in medicinal chemistry and drug discovery.

## Features

- **Interactive Sunburst Visualization**: Click through the DMTA cycle stages
- **Curated GitHub Tools**: Each node links to relevant open-source tools
- **Progressive Exploration**: Drill down from main stages to specific methods
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: 
  - Design: Hit-ID, Hit-to-Lead, Lead Optimization
  - Make: Retrosynthesis, Availability, Synthetic Accessibility
  - Test: Drug Similarity, Off-Target, Biomarker ID, Toxicity
  - Analyze: Data Plotting, ROC Curves, R-Group Analysis, MMP, Activity Cliffs
